        <h4>About</h4>
        <p> Formerly known as [[O****** Q******]], KaliMero is a french plastician, author of graphic novels, painter, poet, also involved in video experimentation. His work has been released in various cities around the world after he got his degree in 1999 at the graphics research school, L'ERG, in Bruxelles. His short stories and comic books were published at FREMOK, La Cinquième Couche, Atrabile, Pyramides, Six Pieds Sous Terre (...). Back in France in 2002 he made drawings for the newspaper Libération, book covers for J'Ai Lu, worked himself as a publisher and managed exhibitions (such as the very first Philippe Vuillemin's retrospesctive !) at Les Requins Marteaux. In 2005 he created Le Voltigeur, in Toulouse, a place dedicated to exhibitions and all kind of crazy happenings, featuring Frank Margerin, Al Foul, Cool Jo, La Maison qui Pue, Henriette Valium, Amandine Urruty, Tanxxx, Marion Puech, Misma, etc. Le Voltigeur was also a bookstore to populate contemporary graphic novels, where Kalimero aka [[O****** Q******]] fired L'Atelier Cartouche for teaching sequential narration himself, inspired by his retired personal Yoda : Claude Renard. Then, a night of 2010, [[O****** Q******]] supposably killed himself, somewhere in Bruxelles underground. His ghost, Kalimero, showed up eleven years after, starting haunting the World Wide Web under the name @kalimero_666, at summer 2021, on Instagram.</p>
